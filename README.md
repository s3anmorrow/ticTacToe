ticTacToe
=========

Rework of a Tic Tac Toe game to HTML5 to be developed over a two day lesson on turn based games. Will become part of the Game Development with HTML5 course launching in the fall.

Graphics generated with Adobe Flash and converted into spritesheets via http://transport.to/spritesheet/

ButtonBehaviour object is reusable - although I would prefer it to inherit the createjs.Sprite class instead of acting as a manager of the button behaviour
This concept might be too advanced for an introductory HTML5 game development course
